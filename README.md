## F1 Timings – Grand Prix Weekend Schedule in IST

F1 Timings is a lightweight, single-page web application designed to display the full schedule of Formula 1 Grand Prix weekends — including Free Practice sessions, Qualifying, Sprint, and Race — automatically converted to Indian Standard Time (IST).

This project was built to solve a simple but frustrating problem: Formula 1 session timings are usually published in UTC or local track time, making it inconvenient for Indian fans to track events in their own timezone. This app makes it effortless. It also offers options for other timezones as well.
